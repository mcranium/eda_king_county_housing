# About the data
- rows
- columns
- geographical coordinates could say something about the relative closeness to cities, the sea or important infrastructure, but this information is likely too complex for the linear regression and the information from the zipcodes is likely to be more valuable for predicting via linear regression

# What to do in general?
- visualise the distributions of the variables
- visualise the correlations between variables (heatplot, correlation matrix)
- visualise correlations between all variables and the housing prize

# What other good dependent variables are there?
- housing prizes per zipcode
- was there an increase in housing prizes over the survey time?
